# 🧠 Intuition on Convolutions – Challenge Explanation

## 📌 Overview

In this challenge, you will build an intuitive understanding of how **Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets)** process images.

Specifically, you will:

- Apply **kernels (filters)** to images  
- Observe how images transform through **convolutional layers (`Conv2D`)**  
- Understand how a ConvNet “sees” and extracts features  

This exercise focuses on building **visual intuition**, not just coding.

## 🔹 What Is a Kernel?

A **kernel** (or filter) is a small matrix used to extract specific features from an image.

Example a 3×3 kernel
